Exercise 9 from file reliability.pdf

Description:
Calculate chance for draw , won all by b team and chance for won minimal one match by b

Patterns:
draw = 100% -(chance for won a + chance for won b)
P(B winning three matches)=P(B wins 1st match)*P(B wins 2nd match)*P(B wins 3rd)
P(B loses three matches)=P(B lose 1st match)*P(B lose 2nd match)*P(B lose 3rd)
P(B wins at least one match) = 100% - P(B loses three matches)

Solution:
1.Ask for number of rounds
2.Ask for chance for win a team
3.Ask for chance for win b team
4.Use patterns
