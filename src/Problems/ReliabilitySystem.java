Problem 3 from file ch11pp.d

Description:
Find the reliability of system

Patterns:
Example for :

     [0,92]              [0,95]
       |                   |
       |                   |
     [0,95]----[0,98]----[0,90]
     R= 0,95 + 0,92 * (1 - 0,95) * 0,98 * 0,90 + 0,95 * (1 - 0,90) = 0,966 what is 96,6%


Solution:
1.Ask for number of horizontal systems
2.Ask for reliabilities of horizontal system
3. ask does this system have an added vertical system
4.if yes or no use other patterns
5.loop from 2. to 4 n times where n is number of horizontal systems
