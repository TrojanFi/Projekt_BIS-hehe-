### Problems:
     PROBLEM 1
     Given the probabilities below, calculate the expected breakdown cost.
     ________________________________________
     |  Number of Breakdowns|Daily Frequency|
     |--------------------------------------|
     |           0          |       3       |
     |           1          |       2       |
     |           2          |       2       |
     |           3          |       3       |
     ----------------------------------------
     Assume a cost of $10 per breakdown.
     
     PROBLEM 2
     RELATIONSHIP AMONG SAMPLE SIZE, CONFIDENCE AND RELIABILITY
     
     PROBLEM 3
     Design a test to demonstrate 100,000 miles life at 95% reliability and 60% confidence.
     The available sample size is 6.(Assume b=2)
     
     PROBLEM 4
     Calculate chance for draw , won all by B team and chance for won minimal one match by B
     
     PROBLEM 5
     Find the reliability of system

     [0,92]              [0,95]
       |                   |
       |                   |
     [0,95]----[0,98]----[0,90]
